## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Current Position</span>
Graduate researcher (PhD in Applied Mathematics) at University of Houston, Texas, US

          
## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Research Interests</span>

My research interests lie in the fields of [random dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_dynamical_system), computational mathematics, inverse problems, and their applications to [mathematical finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance) and [computational biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology). I am now exploring projects in <span style="color: #1E90FF;">computational biology and bioinformatics.</span>  Prior to this, I focused on [Limit Order Book Modelling](https://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/the-limit-order-book) applying stochastic processes and machine learning techniques in financial markets by combining agent‑based simulations, reinforcement learning, and time series models to capture market behavior.

## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Overview</span>
I’m professionally known as **Abdul Rahman** in all my official documents, but I go by my initials **“A.B.” (/eɪ biː/)**. I am a PhD student diving into the fascinating world of **Applied Mathematics**, with a strong foundation from my Master’s in Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Madras), where I studied from 2022 to 2024. My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in **dynamical systems, stochastic analysis, compuational biology and mathematical finance**, fields that captivate me for their complexity, randomness, and real-world applications.  

During my studies, I actively engaged in **projects, seminars, and research** that strengthened my expertise in **computational mathematics, dynamical systems, applied probability, mathematical finance**, and advanced **statistical and data science methods**. I am passionate about exploring new mathematical theories, developing computational skills, and contributing meaningfully to both research and teaching in these areas.  

Beyond academics, I have a **creative side**, reveling in the visual arts through both **painting and photography**. I also enjoy **fitness, cricket, chess, football, and thought-provoking movies**, which help me maintain balance and perspective.  

I am always eager to **connect with like-minded individuals** to discuss mathematics, technology, finance, or shared interests, and I welcome opportunities to exchange ideas and collaborate on meaningful projects.
