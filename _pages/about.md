## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Current Position</span>
Research Intern under [Dr.Neelesh Upadhye](https://math.iitm.ac.in/neelesh)  @ IIT Madras  (_June 2024 - Present_)

## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Research Interests</span>
My research interests lie in the fields of [stochastic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) and its applications to [mathematical finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance). In particular, now I'm working on [Limit Order Book Modelling](https://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/the-limit-order-book) using Stochastic process and Machine learning techniques in financial markets by combining agent‑based simulations  with Reinforcement learning and time series models to capture market behavior.


## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Overview</span>
 I'm Abdul Rahman, a recent graduate with a Master’s degree in Mathematics from the prestigious [Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras)](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), where I studied from 2022 to 2024. My academic journey has been driven by a profound interest in stochastic analysis and financial mathematics, areas that fascinate me due to their complex and impactful nature.

Prior to my Master's, I completed my undergraduate studies from 2018 to 2021 at [Government Arts College](https://gacbe.ac.in/mathematics-faculty.html),Coimbatore,India . During my time there, I excelled academically and graduated as the department topper, an achievement that underscores my dedication and passion for mathematics.

Throughout my academic career, I have actively engaged in various projects and seminars that have deepened my understanding of mathematical concepts and their real-world applications. My coursework and research have equipped me with a solid foundation in stochastic processes, mathematical finance, and advanced statistical methods .

I'm always eager to learn and explore new mathematical theories and their applications, and I look forward to contributing to the field through research and professional endeavors.
