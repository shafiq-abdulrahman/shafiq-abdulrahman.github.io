## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Current Position</span>
Graduate researcher (PhD in Applied Mathematics) at University of Houston, Texas, US

## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Research Interests</span>
My research interests lie in the fields of [random dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_dynamical_system), computational mathematics, inverse problems and its applications to [mathematical finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance). Recently, I was working on [Limit Order Book Modelling](https://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/the-limit-order-book) using Stochastic process and Machine learning techniques in financial markets by combining agent‑based simulations  with Reinforcement learning and time series models to capture market behavior.

## <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1E90FF; color: black;">Overview</span>
I’m Abdul Rahman, a recent Master’s graduate in Mathematics from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras), where I studied from 2022 to 2024. My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in dynamical systems, stochastic analysis, and mathematical finance, areas that fascinate me for their complexity, randomness, and real-world applications.

During my studies, I actively engaged in projects, seminars, and research that strengthened my expertise in computational mathematics, dynamical systems, applied probability, mathematical finance, and advanced statistical and data science methods. I am passionate about exploring new mathematical theories, developing computational skills, and contributing meaningfully to research and professional endeavors in these fields.

Beyond academics, I have a creative side with interests in artwork, photography, and storytelling. I also enjoy fitness, cricket, chess, football, and thought-provoking movies, which help me maintain balance and perspective.

I am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals to discuss mathematics, technology, finance, or shared interests, and I welcome opportunities to exchange ideas and collaborate on meaningful projects
